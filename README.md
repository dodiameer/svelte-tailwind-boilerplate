# Svelte TailwindCSS Boilerplate

Name's pretty self-explainatory. If you want to use TailwindCSS with Svelte, this boilerplate takes care of the boring setup.

## NPM Scripts

- `watch:tailwind`: Watches TailwindCSS file (Don't use this manually)
- `build:tailwind`: Builds TailwindCSS file to index.css (Don't use this manually)
- `build`: Builds Svelte project & TailwindCSS (Use this)
- `dev`: Spins up a development server (Use this)
- `start`: Starts a static server, used to test build (Use this)

## Note

I used a new setup which was slow and would randomly freeze the dev server, so I reverted back to this one
also why is git so difficult?
